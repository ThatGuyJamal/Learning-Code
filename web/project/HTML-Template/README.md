# HTML-Template

First try build a website with coding only.

# Why is this public?

Do give others a good/basic stgarting point on website building.

# How to run on local host:?

Way One - Google it...

What I did:

I used a [vscode extention](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to run the server as a live html file from the browser. This should work, if your not using vscode then just fine a way to run it on your setup. When you install liveserver you should see. A `Go Live` icon on the bottom of the vscode bar. Click it when your selected on the index.html file. Boom your done.
