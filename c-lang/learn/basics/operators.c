//! Operators

// C offers us a wide variety of operators that we can use to operate on data.

// ? In particular, we can identify various groups of operators:

// arithmetic operators
// comparison operators
// logical operators
// compound assignment operators
// bitwise operators
// pointer operators
// structure operators
// miscellaneous operators

// In this section I'm going to detail all of them, using 2 imaginary variables a and b as examples.

// I am keeping bitwise operators, structure operators and pointer operators out of this list, to keep things simpler

//! Arithmetic operators

// In this macro group I am going to separate binary operators and unary operators.

// ? Binary operators work using two operands

// Assignment	a = b
// Addition	a + b
// Subtraction	a - b
// Multiplication	a * b
// Division	a / b
// Modulo	a % b

// ? Unary operators only take one operand:

// Unary plus	+a
// Unary minus	-a
// Increment	a++ or ++a
// Decrement	a-- or --a

// ? The difference between a++ and ++a is that a++ increments the a variable after using it. ++a increments the a variable before using it.

// For example:

// int a = 2;
// int b;
// b = a++ /* b is 2, a is 3 */
// b = ++a /* b is 4, a is 4 */

//The same applies to the decrement operator.

// ! Comparison operators

// Equal operator	a == b
// Not equal operator	a != b
// Bigger than	a > b
// Less than	a < b
// Bigger than or equal to	a >= b
// Less than or equal to	a <= b

// ! Logical operators

//  NOT (example: !a)
// && AND (example: a && b)
// || OR (example: a || b)

// Those operators are great when working with boolean values.

// ! Compound assignment operators

// Those operators are useful to perform an assignment and at the same time perform an arithmetic operation:

// Addition assignment	a += b
// Subtraction assignment	a -= b
// Multiplication assignment	a *= b
// Division assignment	a /= b
// 	Modulo assignment	a %= b

// ! The ternary operator

// The ternary operator is the only operator in C that works with 3 operands, and itâ€™s a short way to express conditionals.

// This is how it looks:

// ? <condition> ? <expression> : <expression> >>> (a ? b : c)

// If a is evaluated to true, then the b statement is executed, otherwise c is.

// The ternary operator is functionality-wise same as an if/else conditional, except it is shorter to express and it can be inlined into an expression.

// ! sizeof

// The sizeof operator returns the size of the operand you pass. You can pass a variable, or even a type.

// ? Example usage:

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int age = 37;
  printf("%ld\n", sizeof(age));
  printf("%ld", sizeof(int));
}

// ! Operator precedence

// ? With all those operators (and more, which I haven't covered in this post, including bitwise, structure operators, and pointer operators), we must pay attention when using them together in a single expression.

// Suppose we have this operation:

// int a = 2;
// int b = 4;
// int c = b + a * a / b - a;

// What's the value of c? Do we get the addition being executed before the multiplication and the division?

// ? There is a set of rules that help us solve this puzzle.

// In order from less precedence to more precedence, we have:

// the = assignment operator
// the + and - binary operators
// the * and / operators
// the + and - unary operators
// Operators also have an associativity rule, which is always left to right except for the unary operators and the assignment.

// In:

// int c = b + a * a / b - a;
// We first execute a * a / b, which, due to being left-to-right, we can separate into a * a and the result / b: 2 * 2 = 4, 4 / 4 = 1.

// Then we can perform the sum and the subtraction: 4 + 1 - 2. The value of c is 3.

// In all cases, however, I want to make sure you realize you can use parentheses to make any similar expression easier to read and comprehend.

// ? Parentheses have higher priority over anything else.

// The above example expression can be rewritten as:

// int c = b + ((a * a) / b) - a;
// and we don't have to think about it that much.
