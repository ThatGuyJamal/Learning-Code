# Learning-Code

Hey Everyone! This is just a repo to log my different learnings in porgraming languages.

## Languages and FrameWorks

Bellow are just a few langs I have my eye on.

| JavaScript   | 3/15/21      | 10/100         |
| TypeScript   | 3/15/21      | 1/100          |
| C Lang | 3/22/21 | 3/100
| Golang       | 3/16/21      | 2/100          |
| html / css   | 3/15/21      | 20/100         |
| React        | 3/16/21      | 9/100          |
| React Native | null         | 0/100          |
| Rust         | null         | 0/100          |
| More soon!   |              |                |

The"last updated" simply shows my last data practicing that language. The learning track is how far I am in learning that lang. It's just an estimate though.
