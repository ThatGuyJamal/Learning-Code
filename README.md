# Learning-Code

Hey Everyone! This is just a repo to log my different learnings in porgraming languages.

No projects are located here, for project info view [here](https://github.com/ThatGuyJamal)

## Languages and FrameWorks

Bellow are just a few langs I have my eye on.

| Golang       | 5/3/21       | 3/100          |

| More soon!   |              |                |

The "last updated" simply shows my last data practicing that language. The learning track is how far I am in learning that lang. It's just an estimate though.
